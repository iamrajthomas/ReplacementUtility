# ReplacementUtility


> This is an utility to replace a specific file or specific folder from source to destination location and keeping a backup of the source.
> This C# Console application is completely configurable, starts from source/destination file or folder location, file/folder name to be replaced.
> This creates a backup of the source file/folder at the configured backup location before replacing the target file/folder.

> You can mention the service name if you want to stop/start while moving the folder from source to destination.
> Once the replacement activities are completed, you can initiate a mail notification to your Email ID informing the task is completed. This is configurable too.

> I created this as a part of the need, having to replace one file and one folder everytime on the server once the deployment gets done.

Note: Please go through the configuration files before running the application.
